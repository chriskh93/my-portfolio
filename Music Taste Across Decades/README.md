## Music Taste Across Decades

This paper was done as part of my Data Visualization course with Johns Hopkins University. This paper performs a statistical and visual analysis of audio feature data of 33,354 musical tracks, whose audio features have been measured by Spotify. Hypotheses testing was performed testing the relationships between genres, popularity, audio features, and time. Popularity is related to genre and time. Instrumentalness, danceability, valence, and energy are correlated with popularity. Genres have characteristic audio features that change with time. Herd music preference trends towards low instrumentalness (â‰ˆ0) and highly danceable tracks (>0.5). Furthermore, herd energy preference forms an Inverted-U shape indicating a sweet spot between energy measures of 0.4 and 0.9. Popularity measures increase with valence up until 0.5, further increases in valence do not result in higher popularity probability.

The research paper can be found [here](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/blob/main/Music%20Taste%20Across%20Decades/Paper/ElKhouri_Final_Paper.pdf) and tests the following hypotheses:
* Hypothesis 1: There is a statistically significant relationship between the genre and decade of a track and its popularity
* Hypothesis 2: There is a statistically significant relationship between the audio features of a track and the popularity.
* Hypothesis 3: There is a statistically significant relationship between the audio features of a track, the genre, and the decade.
