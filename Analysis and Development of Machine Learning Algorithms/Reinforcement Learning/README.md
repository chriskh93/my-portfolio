## Reinforcement Learning

This project develops and asseses the performance of 3 different types of Reinforcement Learning algorithms:
* Value Iteration
* Q-Learning
* SARSA

This project will be solving the racetrack problem, a popular control problem. The goal is to control the movement of a race car (our agent) along a pre-defined racetrack (our environment). The algorithms should enable the race car to get from the starting line to the finish line in a minimum amount of time.

The contents of this project are as follows:

  * [Breast Cancer](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Neural%20Networks/Datasets/Breast%20Cancer): This breast cancer database was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg. The dataset contains 699 points and 2 classes: Benign (denoted by ‘2’) and Malignant (denoted by ‘4’). Including the class variable ‘Class’, the data contains a total of 11 features. 16 missing values need pre-processing and are all under the feature ‘Bare Nuclei’.
