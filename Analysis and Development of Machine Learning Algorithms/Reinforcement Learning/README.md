## Reinforcement Learning

This project develops and asseses the performance of 3 different types of Reinforcement Learning algorithms:
* Value Iteration
* Q-Learning
* SARSA

This project will be solving the racetrack problem, a popular control problem. The goal is to control the movement of a race car (our agent) along a pre-defined racetrack (our environment). The algorithms should enable the race car to get from the starting line to the finish line in a minimum amount of time.
