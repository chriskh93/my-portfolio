## Decision Trees

This project develops and asseses the performance of 2 Decision Tree algorithims:
* ID3: Iterative Dichotomiser 3, this will be implemented for classification models
* CART: Classificiation and Regression Tree, this will be implemented for regression models

The contents of this project are as follows:

* [ElKhouriAssignment3.py](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/blob/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Decision%20Trees/ElKhouriAssignment3.py): The main python code that runs and assesses our algorithms and models
* [Node.py](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/blob/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Decision%20Trees/Node.py): The class Node that defines the node objects that make up the decision tree
* [decisiontree.py](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/blob/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Decision%20Trees/decisiontree.py): The class decisiontree implements both the ID3 and CART modeling algorithms
* [output.txt](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/blob/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Decision%20Trees/output.txt): The output file of our project
* [Datasets](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Decision%20Trees/Datasets):
  * [Breast Cancer](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Decision%20Trees/Datasets/Breast%20Cancer): This breast cancer database was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg. The dataset contains 699 points and 2 classes: Benign (denoted by ‘2’) and Malignant (denoted by ‘4’). Including the class variable ‘Class’, the data contains a total of 11 features.
  * [Car Evaluation](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Decision%20Trees/Datasets/Car%20Evaluation): The data is on evaluations of car acceptability based on price, comfort, and technical specifications. The dataset contains 1728 instances, 4 classes, and 7 columns.
  * [Image Segmentation](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Decision%20Trees/Datasets/Image%20Segmentation): The instances were drawn randomly from a database of 7 outdoor images. The images were hand segmented to create a classification for every pixel. The dataset contains 210 instances, 7 classes, and 20 columns.
  * [Abalone](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Decision%20Trees/Datasets/Abalone): Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements. The dataset contains 4177 instances and 9 columns.
  * [Computer Hardware](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Decision%20Trees/Datasets/Computer%20Hardware): This dataset consists of relative CPU Performance Data. The estimated relative performance values were estimated by the authors using a linear regression method. The results are indicated in the data set as "ERP." The dataset contains 209 instances and 10 columns. 
  * [Forest Fires](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Decision%20Trees/Datasets/Forest%20Fires): This is a difficult regression task, where the aim is to predict the burned area of forest fires, in the northeast region of Portugal, by using meteorological and other data. The dataset contains 517 instances and 13 columns.
