## Analysis and Development of Machine Learning Algorithms

The projects below were completed as part of the course "Introduction to Machine Learning" at Johns Hopkins University. All of the projects consist of implementing at least two machine learning algorithms (with variations). The algorithms are developed and implemented to test their performance on several data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

For each of these assignments, the following deliverables were submitted:
* The source code(s)
* A report describing of the results of the experiments

Python was my programming language of choice and we were not permittee to use any available machine learning libraries such as Matlab toolbox, WEKA, RapidMiner, scikit-learn, etc. All algorithms must be implemented from scratch, and basic libraries for managing data structures and fundamental math operations (e.g., NumPy or Pandas) are permitted.

The projects are as follows:
