  * [Breast Cancer](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Winnow-2%20%26%20Naive%20Bayes/Datasets/Breast%20Cancer): This breast cancer database was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg. The dataset contains 699 points and 2 classes: Benign (denoted by ‘2’) and Malignant (denoted by ‘4’). Including the class variable ‘Class’, the data contains a total of 11 features.
  * [Glass](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Winnow-2%20%26%20Naive%20Bayes/Datasets/Glass): This study of classification of types of glass was motivated by criminological investigation. The dataset contains 214 instances, 6 classes, and 11 columns.
  * [Iris](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Winnow-2%20%26%20Naive%20Bayes/Datasets/Iris): The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.
  * [Soybean (small)](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Winnow-2%20%26%20Naive%20Bayes/Datasets/Soybean): The dataset consists of a small subset of the original soybean database. The dataset contains 47 instances, 4 classes, and 35 columns.
  * [Vote](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Winnow-2%20%26%20Naive%20Bayes/Datasets/Vote): This data set includes votes for each of the U.S. House of Representatives Congressmen on the 16 key votes identified by the Congressional Quarterly Almanac. The dataset contains 435 instances, 2 classes, and 17 columns
