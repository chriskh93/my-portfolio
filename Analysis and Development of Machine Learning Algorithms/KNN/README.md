  * [Glass](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/KNN/Datasets/Glass): This study of classification of types of glass was motivated by criminological investigation. The dataset contains 214 instances, 6 classes, and 11 columns.
  * [Image Segmentation](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/KNN/Datasets/Image%20Segmentation): The instances were drawn randomly from a database of 7 outdoor images. The images were hand segmented to create a classification for every pixel. The dataset contains 210 instances, 7 classes, and 20 columns.
