## Feedforward Neural Networks

This project develops and asseses the performance of Feedforward Neural Networks that are trained with backpropagation, we will be assesing the performance of multilayer perceptrons consisting of 0,1, and 2 hidden layers for both classification and regression

The contents of this project are as follows:
* [Report](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Neural%20Networks/Report): The report of the project
* [ElKhouriAssignment5.py](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/blob/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Neural%20Networks/ElKhouriAssignment5.py): The main python code that runs and assesses our algorithms
* [backprop.py](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/blob/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Neural%20Networks/backprop.py): The class backprop which implements the backpropagation feedforward neural network model
* [output.txt](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/blob/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Neural%20Networks/output.txt): The output file of our project
* [Datasets](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Neural%20Networks/Datasets):
  * [Breast Cancer](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Neural%20Networks/Datasets/Breast%20Cancer): This breast cancer database was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg. The dataset contains 699 points and 2 classes: Benign (denoted by ‘2’) and Malignant (denoted by ‘4’). Including the class variable ‘Class’, the data contains a total of 11 features. 16 missing values need pre-processing and are all under the feature ‘Bare Nuclei’.
  * [Glass](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Neural%20Networks/Datasets/Glass): This study of classification of types of glass was motivated by criminological investigation. The dataset contains 214 instances, 6 classes, and 11 columns.
  * [Soybean (small)](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Neural%20Networks/Datasets/Soybean): The dataset consists of a small subset of the original soybean database. The dataset contains 47 instances, 4 classes, and 35 columns.
  * [Abalone](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Neural%20Networks/Datasets/Abalone): Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements. The dataset contains 4177 instances and 9 columns.
  * [Computer Hardware](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Neural%20Networks/Datasets/Computer%20Hardware): This dataset consists of relative CPU Performance Data. The estimated relative performance values were estimated by the authors using a linear regression method. The results are indicated in the data set as "ERP." The dataset contains 209 instances and 10 columns. 
  * [Forest Fires](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Neural%20Networks/Datasets/Forest%20Fires): This is a difficult regression task, where the aim is to predict the burned area of forest fires, in the northeast region of Portugal, by using meteorological and other data. The dataset contains 517 instances and 13 columns.
