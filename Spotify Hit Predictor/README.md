## Spotify Hit Predictor

This project was done as part of my Data Mining course with Johns Hopkins University. It builds on my previous research conducted in the titled [Music Taste Across Decades: Spotify Audio Feature Analysis of 33,354 Musical Pieces](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/blob/main/Music%20Taste%20Across%20Decades/Paper/ElKhouri_Final_Paper.pdf). Based on my previous analytical results, I built a model that predicts the hit status of an arbitrary track using its audio features, decade, and genre.

The report can be found [here](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/blob/main/Spotify%20Hit%20Predictor/Paper/ElKhouri_Final_Project_Paper.pdf) and tests the performance of 4 ML algorithms:
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees
* K-NN
* Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP)

A model accuracy of 85% was found with MLP with a false positive rate of only 19%. 

The supporting code can be found [here](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Spotify%20Hit%20Predictor/Code)
