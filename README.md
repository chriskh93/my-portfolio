# My Portfolio

* [Music Taste Across Decades: Spotify Audio Feature Analysis of 33,354 Musical Pieces](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Music%20Taste%20Across%20Decades):This project was done as part of my *Data Visualization* course with Johns Hopkins University. This paper performs a statistical and visual analysis of audio feature data of 33,354 musical tracks, whose audio features have been measured by Spotify. Hypotheses testing was performed testing the relationships between genres, popularity, audio features, and time. 
* [Mr.Draper Size Recommender Project](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Mr.Draper%20Size%20Recommender%20Project): Development and implementation of a size recommender for Mr.Draper,the first and fasting growing digital styling service for men in the Middle East.
* [US Census Data Analysis with Income](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/US%20Census%20Data%20Analysis):The dataframe provided contains US Census data with detailed but anonymized information for 300,000 individuals along with income information. The objective was to identify the characteristics associated with an individual earning a total income of more or less than $50,000 a year.
* [Modeling MPG from Vehicle Data](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/blob/main/MPG%20Modeling/Mpg_modeling.ipynb): This project was done as part of my *Fundamentals of Data Science* course with Johns Hopkins University. The objective was to build a predictive model for miles per gallon (mpg) using vehicle data. The project consists of ETL, EDA, Model Building, Model Description, and Model Utilization.
* [Analysis and Development of Machine Learning Algorithms](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms): The projects below were completed as part of the course *Machine Learning* with Johns Hopkins University. All of the projects consist of implementing at least two machine learning algorithms (with variations). The algorithms are developed and implemented to test their performance on several data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
  * [Winnow-2 & Naive Bayes](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Winnow-2%20%26%20Naive%20Bayes)
  * [KNN](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/KNN)
  * [Decision Trees](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Decision%20Trees)
  * [Logistic Regression & Adaline](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Logistic%20Regression%20%26%20Adaline)
  * [Neural Networks](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Neural%20Networks)
  * [Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Analysis%20and%20Development%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms/Reinforcement%20Learning)
