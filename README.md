* [Music Taste Across Decades: Spotify Audio Feature Analysis of 33,354 Musical Pieces](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Music%20Taste%20Across%20Decades)
* [Mr.Draper Size Recommender Project](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/Mr.Draper%20Size%20Recommender%20Project)
* [US Census Data Analysis with Income](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/tree/main/US%20Census%20Data%20Analysis)
* [Modeling MPG from Vehicle Data](https://github.com/chriskh93/my-portfolio/blob/main/MPG%20Modeling/Mpg_modeling.ipynb): This project was done as part of my *Fundamentals of Data Science* course with Johns Hopkins University. The objective was to build a predictive model for miles per gallon (mpg) using vehicle data. The project consists of ETL, EDA, Model Building, Model Description, and Model Utilization.
